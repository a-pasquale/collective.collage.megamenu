Installation
============

* Add ``collective.collage.megamenu`` to the list of eggs to install and
  extend to a known good set for ``plone.app.registry``::

    [buildout]
    ...
    extends = 
        ...
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.registry/1.0b2
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.collage.megamenu

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.collage.megamenu

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are using Plone 3.3 or if you are going to explicitly include
the package from another package's configure.zcml file.
